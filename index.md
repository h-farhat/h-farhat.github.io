## Introduction

My name is Haddy, and I began pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering in November of 2022. While working full-time, I navigated the challenge of balancing my academic responsibilities with my professional commitments. This experience allowed me to develop and refine my time management skills, ensuring I could stay organized, meet deadlines, and deliver high-quality work both professionally and academically. This portfolio showcases the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout my studies and demonstrates how I applied them to enhance and overhaul my chosen artifact.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU and developing my ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on the journey I've taken and how much I've learned and improved since the start of the program. Throughout all of the courses I've completed, I have managed to deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts that are essential to my goal of becoming a full-stack developer. Many projects and assignments I've completed often required tackling complex challenges with specific requirements, which helped me strengthen my programming abilities and my problem-solving skills. These experiences have taught me to break down problems into manageable pieces, adapt when a situation calls for it, and deliver high-quality solutions that are both functional and maintainable.

While my work within this program has been mostly independent, my professional work has provided me many opportunities to collaborate in team environments and communicate effectively with stakeholders. Often, I work closely with colleagues to plan, develop, and deliver projects while following a strict set of requirements and tight time constraints. These experiences have strengthened my ability to contribute in team environments, listen and apply feedback, and adapt when things aren't going as expected. Through my academic and professional work, I've learned how to design and document professional-quality communications that are concise and tailored for the intended audience. When working with stakeholders, I focus on understanding their needs and technical requests and ensure that my solutions address the given requirements while meeting user expectations. Within courses, I've collaborated with peers in discussion posts and occasional group projects. Many projects required documentation which helped refine my ability to explain technical ideas to a variety of audiences. This includes how to accurately portray functionality through detailed diagrams.

Over the course of my studies in the Computer Science program, I've gained proficiency in key areas such as data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases, and security. My work in data structures and algorithms taught me how design decisions at this stage directly affect performance, scalability, and maintainability. I learned about time complexity, sorting techniques, and data retrieval in many of the courses offered. This has helped me better understand how these factors affect systems and how to determine the most effective option in each situation. In software engineering, I gained experience building many applications with different functionality and requirements. From full-stack development with user authentication, secure data handling, and API integration to mobile apps with intuitive interface design, I've expanded my skill set signifcantly. I've worked with databases within many of the program's courses, throughout projects and enhancement three, I've demonstrated my ability to implement scalable and secure data storage using many different database providers. Security was an important concept within this program, I practiced building secure systems by implementing authentication, restricting access, validating user input, and learning about common vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques. I've incorporated a security-focused mindset into my programming best practices to ensure that the systems I build are functional and secure.

The artifact I selected for my three enhancements serves as the central piece of my portfolio because it demonstrates the full range of my abilities and knowledge. Starting as a basic inventory manager, it provided an ideal foundation for improvement across all enhancement categories. My enhancements have allowed me to demonstrate the progress I've made across several critical computer science concepts. For each enhancement, I identified areas for improvement, applied effective solutions, and documented my reasoning and outcomes. Overall, these enhancements demonstrate my ability to write effective and secure code while also considering user experience, maintainability, and scalability.

## Portfolio Summary

The artifact I have chosen for all three enhancements is an inventory management mobile application originally developed for CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The initial version of the application was created in Android Studio using Java and a local SQLite database. It was built to serve as a basic implementation of an inventory manager, containing only the required functionality. Users could register an account and manage their inventory by tracking each item's name, quantity, and value. I selected this project because it presented the most challenging option available and touched on multiple development aspects I aimed to improve, including intuitive user interface design, database integration, and mobile application development. These were skills I was interested in strengthening, and throughout my enhancements, I significantly improved the quality of this artifact. The original artifact was developed under tight time constraints and lacked several features necessary for an effective inventory management system. My enhancements focused on improving the application entirely, refining its functionality and usability, which resulted in a far more complete and effective inventory manager.

This artifact served as the foundation for three enhancement categories: **Software Design and Engineering**, **Algorithms and Data Structure**, and **Databases**. Through the implementation of these enhancements, I demonstrated mastery of all five course outcomes, which include:

1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science

2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices

4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals

5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

## Code Review

This code review focuses on the artifact that all three enhancements were completed on. Originally developed in CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming, I've analyzed this artifact based on its existing functionality, areas of improvement, and the overall impact of each enhancement. In this review, I discuss the specific issues each enhancement addresses and explain how they align with relevant course outcomes.
