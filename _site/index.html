<h2 id="professional-self-assessment">Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

<p>Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU and developing my ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on the journey I’ve taken and how much I’ve learned and improved since the start of the program. Throughout all of the courses I’ve completed, I have managed to deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts that are essential to my goal of becoming a full-stack developer. Many projects and assignments I’ve completed often required tackling complex challenges with specific requirements, which helped me strengthen my programming abilities and my problem-solving skills. These experiences have taught me to break down problems into manageable pieces, adapt when a situation calls for it, and deliver high-quality solutions that are both functional and maintainable.</p>

<p>While my work within this program has been mostly independent, my professional work has provided me many opportunities to collaborate in team environments and communicate effectively with stakeholders. Often, I work closely with colleagues to plan, develop, and deliver projects while following a strict set of requirements and tight time constraints. These experiences have strengthened my ability to contribute in team environments, listen and apply feedback, and adapt when things aren’t going as expected. Through my academic and professional work, I’ve learned how to design and document professional-quality communications that are concise and tailored for the intended audience. When working with stakeholders, I focus on understanding their needs and technical requests and ensure that my solutions address the given requirements while meeting user expectations. Within courses, I’ve collaborated with peers in discussion posts and occasional group projects. Many projects required documentation which helped refine my ability to explain technical ideas to a variety of audiences. This includes how to accurately portray functionality through detailed diagrams.</p>

<p>Over the course of my studies in the Computer Science program, I’ve gained proficiency in key areas such as data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases, and security. My work in data structures and algorithms taught me how design decisions at this stage directly affect performance, scalability, and maintainability. I learned about time complexity, sorting techniques, and data retrieval in many of the courses offered. This has helped me better understand how these factors affect systems and how to determine the most effective option in each situation. In software engineering, I gained experience building many applications with different functionalities and requirements. From full-stack development with user authentication, secure data handling, and API integration to mobile apps with intuitive interface design, I’ve expanded my skill set signifcantly. I’ve worked with databases within many of the program’s courses, throughout projects and enhancement three, I’ve demonstrated my ability to implement scalable and secure data storage using many different database providers. Security was an important concept within this program, I practiced building secure systems by implementing authentication, restricting access, validating user input, and learning about common vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques. I’ve incorporated a security-focused mindset into my programming best practices to ensure that the systems I build are functional and secure.</p>

<p>The artifact I selected for my three enhancements serves as the central piece of my portfolio because it demonstrates the full range of my abilities and knowledge. Starting as a basic inventory manager, it provided an ideal foundation for improvement across all enhancement categories. My enhancements have allowed me to demonstrate the progress I’ve made across several critical computer science concepts. For each enhancement, I identified areas for improvement, applied effective solutions, and documented my reasoning and outcomes. Overall, these enhancements demonstrate my ability to write effective and secure code while also considering user experience, maintainability, and scalability.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-summary">Portfolio Summary</h2>

<p>The artifact I have chosen for all three enhancements is an inventory management mobile application originally developed for CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The initial version of the application was created in Android Studio using Java and a local SQLite database. It was built to serve as a basic implementation of an inventory manager, containing only the required functionality. Users could register an account and manage their inventory by tracking each item’s name, quantity, and value. I selected this project because it presented the most challenging option available and touched on multiple development aspects I aimed to improve, including intuitive user interface design, database integration, and mobile application development. These were skills I was interested in strengthening, and throughout my enhancements, I significantly improved the quality of this artifact. The original artifact was developed under tight time constraints and lacked several features necessary for an effective inventory management system. My enhancements focused on improving the application entirely, refining its functionality and usability, which resulted in a far more complete and effective inventory manager.</p>

<p>This artifact served as the foundation for three enhancement categories: <strong>Software Design and Engineering</strong>, <strong>Algorithms and Data Structure</strong>, and <strong>Databases</strong>. Through the implementation of these enhancements, I demonstrated mastery of all five course outcomes, which include:</p>

<h2 id="software-design-and-engineering">Software Design and Engineering</h2>
<h3 id="inventory-manager-cs-360-mobile-architecture-and-programming---enhancement-one">Inventory Manager (CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming - Enhancement One)</h3>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> This artifact was selected for enhancement one because it was originally developed under significant time constraints, resulting in code that was rushed and lacking in quality. The codebase contained large sections of redundant code, which made it harder to maintain and upgrade. There was also a lack of in-line comments which played a part in reducing the application’s readability and maintainability. Addressing these issues provided an opportunity to strengthen the artifact’s overall design and maintainability, while also demonstrating my ability to refactor code, improve efficiency, and document decisions effectively for future use.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This enhancement consisted of migrating the current Java codebase into Kotlin, which is ideal for an Android mobile application as Kotlin is specifically designed for Android development. Using Kotlin’s concise syntax, safety features, and built-in functions, I successfully refactored the codebase to be easier to read and maintain. The codebase now includes detailed in-line comments that portray essential information which is especially helpful when future collaborators are making upgrades. To solve the issue with redundant code, reusable logic has been converted into utility functions that can be accessed easily and modified in a single area. While performing the conversion to Kotlin, I also resolved issues with input validation and type safety which was an oversight in the original artifact. These upgrades to the codebase showcase my ability to refactor code effectively, build applications with security in mind, and document my technical decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Course Outcomes:</strong> Enhancement one achieves course outcomes one, two, and four. Course outcome one is achieved by showcasing collaborative skills which make the code easier to read and maintain. Course outcome two is achieved through detailed in-line comments and utility functions which showcase my ability to communicate technical concepts in a clear and professional manner. Course outcome four is achieved through utilizing Android Studio’s Java to Kotlin converter which demonstrates my ability to use industry practices and tools to improve software quality.</p>

<h2 id="algorithms-and-data-structure">Algorithms and Data Structure</h2>
<h3 id="inventory-manager-cs-360-mobile-architecture-and-programming---enhancement-two">Inventory Manager (CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming - Enhancement Two)</h3>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> This artifact was selected for enhancement two because the original artifact lacked several essential features that are critical for making an inventory manager practical and user-friendly. Without the ability to search or sort through items, the application was limited in functionality and not feasible for real-world use. It was especially difficult to navigate through larger inventories where sorting through items one-by-one would take far too long. Addressing these issues provided an opportunity to enhance the artifact’s useability and significantly improve user experience, while also demonstrating my ability to design and implement algorithmic features in a real-world context.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This enhancement consisted of implementing search and sort algorithms to improve how data is retrieved and sorted within an inventory. This implementation allows users to search and organize their inventory efficiently which makes the application much more practical and user-friendly. The application’s interface was also updated to accommodate these new features. A search icon has been added to the top bar that expands to allow users to filter by an item’s name while displaying the search results. A sort icon has also been included that displays a sort menu that allows users to sort by the date an item was added, alphabetical order, quantity, and value. The sort menu also includes sort directions to allow users to view their inventory by ascending or descending order. Sort preferences are saved and automatically applied when a user views their inventory for the sake of convenience. These upgrades to the application’s functionality showcase my ability to use algorithms to solve a practical problem and create intuitive user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Course Outcomes:</strong> Enhancement two achieves course outcomes three and four. Course outcome three is achieved by addressing the problem of impractical inventory navigation through algorithmic thinking, applying efficient techniques to optimize how inventory items are displayed. Course outcome four is achieved through the use of industry-specific techniques to improve user experience and deliver value through Kotlin’s sort methods which enabled me to implement custom sort logic that included sort types and directions.</p>

<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>
<h3 id="inventory-manager-cs-360-mobile-architecture-and-programming---enhancement-three">Inventory Manager (CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming - Enhancement Three)</h3>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> This artifact was selected for enhancement three because the original artifact was developed using a local SQLite database which did fulfill the basic requirements of the application but lacked important features and security. Using a local database resulted in user information being stored in an easily accessible format, which is a major security risk. This also made shared use of an inventory impossible as data is saved locally which meant it could not be used across multiple devices. Businesses often have multiple individuals modifying a shared inventory which meant that the original implementation lacked the necessary functionality for real-world usage. The database was not designed to scale as data or users increased and was instead stored within the device, this limits the application significantly and is an inconvenience to users. Addressing these issues provided an opportunity to strengthen the artifact’s reliability and security, while also providing broader accessibility and long-term scalability. This demonstrates my ability to determine limitations within a system and implement databases that are secure, adaptable, and aligned with development standards.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This enhancement consisted of migrating the local SQLite database to Cloud Firestore. This implementation introduced a secure and scalable database that enabled collaboration among users to manage shared inventories. Using Firebase Authentication and its security rules, users have their data securely stored on the cloud and are incapable of accessing or modifying data that isn’t tied to their account. This upgrade also removes the limit imposed by using a device for storage, Cloud Firestore allows us to scale as needed while taking the burden off the user. This upgrade to the database showcases my ability to develop with a security-focused mindset while signficantly improving the functionality and reliability of an application.</p>

<p><strong>Course Outcomes:</strong> Enhancement three achieves course outcome five by securely storing data and anticipating unauthorized data access or tampering and preventing them through security rules.</p>
